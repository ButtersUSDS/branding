#About our typography
The U.S. Digital Service visual identity makes use of the two fonts recommended by the U.S. Web Design Standards: Merriweather and Source Sans Pro. These are both free, open source fonts supported across browsers and systems. 

For more about the rationale for the font selection, visit https://standards.usa.gov/typography/

Download both fonts from this folder or [online] (https://www.google.com/fonts#UsePlace:use/Collection:Source+Sans+Pro:400,300,400italic,600,700|Merriweather:400,300,700,400italic).
