#USDS Illustrations

These illustrations were created by illustrious USDS designer Stephanie Nguyen to bring some of our organization's cultural touchstones to life, including but not limited to Crab Claws, the Oval Office (ours, not theirs), Maggie the Mouse of Jackson Place, and more. Please use them at your leisure for branding/comms needs. Thanks!
